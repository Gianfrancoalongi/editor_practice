this is a text with some similar stuff in it, but in different places.
the intent of the text is to help as basic data for several different types
of manipulation that can be conducted with editors.
for example, capitalizing the first letter of every row regardless of if 
it is right to do or not (the outlook transformation).
Or maybe capitalizing all words that match a specific pattern, or all 
letters of words with numbers emedded within them?
Who knows.
at the moment it is hard to tell, but I think that I will add some numbers
into this text - as for example, I estimate that I drink maybe 5 to 7 
cups of coffee per day at work.
this is too much, granted, I do get ill when I pas this threshold, sometimes
I can feel sweaty and nauseous when I drink too many coffees. 
This usually happens at 15:00 and onward, just like the Vindaloo stomach 
ache.
