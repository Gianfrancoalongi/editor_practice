this is a text with some similar stuff in it, but in different places.
the intent of the text is to help as basic data for several different types
of manipulation that can be conducted with editors.
for example, capitalizing the first letter of every row regardless of if 
it is right to do or not (the outlook transformation).
Or maybe capitalizing all words that match a specific pattern, or all 
letters of words with numbers emedded within them?
Who knows.
at the moment it is hard to tell, but I think that I will add some numbers
into this text - as for example, I estimate that I drink maybe 5 to 7 
cups of coffee per day at work.
this is too much, granted, I do get ill when I pas this threshold, sometimes
I can feel sweaty and nauseous when I drink too many coffees. 
This usually happens at 15:00 and onward, just like the Vindaloo stomach 
ache. 
this text is obviously not enough, although I do now that it can be
hard for people to see the differences for the different steps, 
I assume that they know how to use diff or similar tools to easily
identity where the changes are.
this is also a skill that needs to be mastered, for this purpose I might
add exercises for pure practice of finding files, finding differences in files,
or differences in structures.
lastly, something that I see every day is that colleagues are not truly comfortable with 
the tools they use. I want us all to feel at home with all commands we have
at our disposal, we should know and learn how to wield the power at
our fingertips, and how to create the power we are missing.
as developers, and more specifically Craftsmen, we can craft our own
tools when we miss some, but also know what exists, and avoid 
reinventing the wheel purely based on ignorance, if not for training purposes,
it is unprofessional to write a tool that does something that another tool 
already does.
